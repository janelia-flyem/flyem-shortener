This directory was based on the "Hello World" example for Google Cloud Run,
but uses a different container (one suitable for running conda-based code).

To build and upload container with Google Cloudbuild registry:

    gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/dvid-em/helloworld

To build FASTER using the most recent container as the cache:

    gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild.yaml

NOTE: Neither of the above commands will actually DEPLOY the container.
      The easiest way to do that is via the google cloud console.
