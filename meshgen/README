# This directory contains the setup for a container that can be used with
# Google's "Cloud Run" service to generate meshes on-the-fly, and upload
# them to DVID along the way.

# To build and upload container with Google Cloudbuild registry:
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/dvid-em/meshgen

# To build FASTER using the most recent container as the cache:
gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild.yaml
